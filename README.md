## Installation:
From the command line run NPM i to install NPM packages required, then from the index file, run npm start to run the program from the CLI.

## Usage:
 This project is intended to be used to expand my understanding of the interaction between MySQL and the routes it uses as well as display my knowledge to help calibrate my skills to those who will benefit from them.  :compass:
